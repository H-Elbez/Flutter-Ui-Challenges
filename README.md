# Flutter UI Challenges

Flutter UI design implementation repository for interesting UI Designs that
are available in websites like <a href="https://dribbble.com" target="_blank">Dribbble</a>
.

The challenge is to see if we can re create any design out there
(including animations etc) using just Flutter.
